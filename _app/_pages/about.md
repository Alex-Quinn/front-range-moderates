The List
{: .largetype}
Front Range Moderates is a list of (roughly) 100 high-quality boulders around the Front Range of Colorado. Think fun, classic, and relatively safe boulders that are perfect for the "volume day" you never get around to.

The initial list came from all the 3 and 4 star boulders (without a highball rating) from Phillip Benningfield and Matt Samet's [_Colorado Bouldering: Front Range_](https://stores.sharpendbooks.com/colorado-bouldering-front-range/){:target="_blank"} guidebook.

Since then, it has been heavily tweaked based on my subjective opinions of  quality and safety.

It‚Äôs a living list. Expect changes as I climb more of the boulders.

But... why?
{: .largetype}
Ever trekked out to climb a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù only to find it‚Äôs crumbly, awkward, or dangerous? Yeah, me too.

Some days, exploring is part of the fun. Other days, you just want curated list.

Defining "moderate"
{: .largetype}
For the purposes of this list, "moderate" means:
- V0 - V5
- Boulders you can climb (and fall off) safely with a couple of pads and a spotter

Just give me a spreadsheet!

Feedback
{: .largetype}
The list is always evolving and I haven't climbed (or even stood under) every boulder.

If you have thoughts (especially, flagging dangerous boulders), send a note to [hello@frontrangemoderates.com](mailto:hello@frontrangemoderates.com).
