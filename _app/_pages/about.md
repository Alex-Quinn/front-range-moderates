What is Front Range Moderates?
{: .largetype}
Front Range Moderates is a list of (roughly) 100 high-quality boulders around the Front Range of Colorado. Think fun, classic, and relatively safe boulders that are perfect for the "volume day" you never get around to.

The list
{: .largetype}
The initial list came from all the 3 and 4 star boulders (without a highball rating) from Phillip Benningfield and Matt Samet's [_Colorado Bouldering: Front Range_](https://stores.sharpendbooks.com/colorado-bouldering-front-range/){:target="_blank"} guidebook.

Since then, it has been heavily tweaked based on my subjective opinions on quality and safety.

It‚Äôs a living list. Expect changes as I climb more of the boulders.

But... why?
{: .largetype}
Ever trekked out to climb a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù only to find it‚Äôs crumbly, awkward, or dangerous? Yeah, me too.

Some days, exploring is part of the fun. Other days, you just want a solid, curated list.

Defining "moderate"
{: .largetype}
For the purposes of this list, "moderate" means:
- V0 - V5
- Boulders you can climb (and fall off) safely with a couple of pads and a spotter

Feedback & contributions
{: .largetype}
The list is always evolving and I haven't climbed (or even stood under) every boulder.

If you have thoughts (especially, flagging dangerous boulders), send a note to [hello@frontrangemoderates.com](mailto:hello@frontrangemoderates.com). You could also [submit an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Alex-Quinn/front-range-moderates){:target="_blank"} if that's your jam.
