The List
{: .largetype}
Front Range Moderates is a list of (roughly) 100 high-quality boulders around the Front Range of Colorado. Think fun, classic, and relatively safe boulders that are perfect for the "volume day" you never get around to.

It’s a living list. Expect changes as I climb more of the boulders.

Defining "moderate"
{: .largetype}
For the purposes of this list, "moderate" means:
- V0 - V5
- Boulders you can climb (and fall off) safely with a couple of pads and a spotter

Just give me a spreadsheet!

Feedback
{: .largetype}
The list is always evolving and I haven't climbed (or even stood under) every boulder.

If you have thoughts (especially, flagging dangerous boulders), send a note to [hello@frontrangemoderates.com](mailto:hello@frontrangemoderates.com).
