Description
{: .largetype}
Despite technically being an eliminate, Major Tom is fun and worthwhile. Tall folks can statically reach the good sloper. Shorter folks might need to huck.

This boulder isn't tall but the landing is a bit rocky. Some accessory pads are nice to fill holes and build a flat landing.
