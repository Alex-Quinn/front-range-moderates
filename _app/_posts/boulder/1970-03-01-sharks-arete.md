Description
{: .largetype}
An obvious striking line as you walk around the Great Ridge area. Some interesting moves down low lead to some monster jugs in the second half.

The boulder feels a bit airy up top and it will be just on the edge of "safe" for some due to its height. That said, the landing is completely flat and the top out is on great jugs.
