Description
{: .largetype}
Bring your slab slippers to prance up this thing. Or, if you're like me, climb it like a vert face and shred your fingers while over gripping the sharp crystals. Such a classic feature in the middle of the boulder field. A fall from the top would be a bit sketchy (run backward down the slab?).
