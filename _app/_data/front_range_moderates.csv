Milton,V4,Eldorado Canyon,A classic line on a classic boulder in Eldo. Small holds and tricky movement on a beautiful slab. The boulder sits literally in a the parking area. Very convenient for warming up during the winter conditions needed to make the holds feel good.,,
Gill Face,V2,Eldorado Canyon,A sometimes overlooked line on the Gill Boulder. Well worth doingâ€”especially if you're over trying the slab lines on the south face. Interesting movement off the ground leads to a fun and easier top out.

The Buddha Belly,V3,Eldorado Canyon,There's not a ton at the Freight Train Boulder but The Buddha Belly is well worth the visit. Unique moves on comfy holds. It's just tall enough to be interesting but there are massive jugs at the top. Flat and clear landing.

Jaws,V3,Lumpy Ridge,An insanely cool feature (looks like a shark!) that begs to be climbed. The holds are a bit sharp but the moves are fun. Did I mention it looks like a shark?!,"- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105749368/jaws){:target=""_blank""}",
Tooth Boulder Arete,V0,Lumpy Ridge,A less slabby (but still very technical!) cousin to the slab around the corner. Slap your way up the arete until you hit a monster jug at the top.

Tooth Boulder Slab,V0,Lumpy Ridge,"Bring your slab slippers to prance up this thing. Or, if you're like me, climb it like a vert face and shred your fingers while over gripping the sharp crystals. Such a classic feature in the middle of the boulder field. A fall from the top would be a bit sketchy (run backward down the slab?).","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105749362/tooth-slab){:target=""_blank""}

Monkey Traverse,V4,Flagstaff,,,
The Pillar,V2,Flagstaff,Intro to refrigerator slapping! Fun powerful moves and heel hooks on jugs. Lowball but a tiered landing that can be a tad complicated to protect.,"- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/107514862/the-pillar){:target=""_blank""}",
Shark's Arete,V3,Flagstaff,"An obvious striking line as you walk around the Great Ridge area. Some interesting moves down low lead to some monster jugs in the second half.

The boulder feels a bit airy up top and it will be just on the edge of ""safe"" for some due to its height. That said, the landing is completely flat and the top out is on great jugs.","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105811319/shark-arete){:target=""_blank""}",
Pratt's Mantel,V2,Flagstaff,,,
That Flakes It,V4,Flagstaff,,,
Beer Barrel - Southwest Corner,V0,Flagstaff,"Fun moves on comfy holds. One of the rare high-quality and not highball V0s at Flagstaff.

Despite looking like 100% jugs at the top, the topout involves some slopers. Bring a couple pads to protect the rocky (but safe) landing.","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105749257/southwest-prow){:target=""_blank""}",

Original Grapple,V4,Flatirons,"Fun roof climbing with power moves and heel hook trickery.

A blubber pad is useful to protect the dabby boulder in the landing.","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105751345/original-grapple){:target=""_blank""}",
BBC - South Warmup,V0,Flatirons,"If you've been to the Satellites, you've probably warmed up on this. One of the few V0s around that feels like a proper jug haul warmup. Monster jugs topping out to a perfect view of Boulder is icing on the cake. ","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105757876/south-warmup){:target=""_blank""}",
Aerogel V3 Variation,V3,Flatirons,"As you walk up the final stretch to the main Satellites cluster, this boulder begs to be climbed. There are a number of variations on the boulder but the V3 variation (big huck to the horn from the sloper) is the best.","- [Mountain Project poorly describes a V5 variation](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105751348/aerogel){:target=""_blank""}",
Major Tom,V3,Flatirons,"Despite technically being an eliminate, Major Tom is fun and worthwhile. Tall folks can statically reach the good sloper. Shorter folks might need to huck.

This boulder isn't tall but the landing is a bit rocky. Some accessory pads are nice to fill holes and build a flat landing.","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105757477/major-tom){:target=""_blank""}",
A7 V1,V1,Flatirons,"Heel hooking, toe hooking goodness. Getting to the lip is the crux. Do a couple hip stretches before pulling on.","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105752380/a7-v1){:target=""_blank""}",

Easy to find once you know where it is. Maybe bring a lunch if you're exploring the boulders on Green Mountain for the first time.

The landing is a mildly rocky and trends downhill. I'd recommend a few pads and a spotter.","- [Colorado Bouldering: Front Range](https://stores.sharpendbooks.com/colorado-bouldering-front-range/){:target=""_blank""}",

Dihedral Problem,V2,Three Sisters,"An obvious line that sucks most parties in as they walk past. Some tricky beta down low is fun to unlock. From there, you get powerful moves on big holds. A worthwhile stop on the Three Sisters moderate circuit.","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106257778/dihedral-problem){:target=""_blank""}",
Sad Face,V2,Three Sisters,A nice reprieve from the small sharp holds of Three Sisters. Steep climbing on big holds leads to a surprisingly interesting topout.,"- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106462897/the-sad-face){:target=""_blank""}",
The Lukes,V4,Three Sisters,"A perfect line of crimps leads to a nuanced topout. A dark horse contender for top five V4s on the Front Range? Get on it and decide for yourself!

Can be tricky to find but it's worth the wander. Up and around the corner lookers right from the Piano boulder.

The top can hold snow in the winter and seep for quite a while.","- [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106490898/the-lukes-aka-loyalty-to-skill){:target=""_blank""}",
